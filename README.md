### Sentiment-Analysis

This code performs sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) NLP model. 

The analysis is performed by looping through each review, applying the model, and extracting sentiment scores. The resulting sentiment scores are added to the Dataframe, providing an overall sentiment analysis for the Yelp reviews.
