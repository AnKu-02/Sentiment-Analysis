# Sentiment-Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes the `BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)` model for sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews. By leveraging the `transformers` library and BERT's pre-trained models, we can infer the sentiment behind each review - ranging from highly negative to highly positive. This analysis aims to automate the process of understanding customer feedback, which can be invaluable for businesses looking to improve their services or products.

## Installation
First, ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries.

## Key Libraries
- **transformers**: Provides access to the pre-trained BERT models for NLP tasks.
- **torch**: The PyTorch library, a foundational package for scientific computing and machine learning.
- **requests**: Enables HTTP requests to fetch web content.
- **beautifulsoup4**: Parses HTML and XML documents, allowing for easy data extraction from web pages.
- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## How It Works
- **Model Initialization**: Instantiate the BERT model and tokenizer designed for sentiment analysis.
- **Sentiment Calculation**: Tokenize the input review text and use the model to classify the sentiment.
- **Data Collection**: Fetch reviews from Yelp using requests and parse the HTML with BeautifulSoup.
- **Review Scoring**: Load reviews into a pandas DataFrame and apply the sentiment analysis model to each review.
- **Analysis**: Each review is scored with a sentiment value, indicating the positivity or negativity of the feedback.

## Example Analysis
After running the script, you'll have a DataFrame with each Yelp review and its corresponding sentiment score, allowing for easy analysis and insight generation. This can be particularly useful for identifying areas of improvement or highlighting positive aspects of your business based on customer feedback.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models for practical applications like sentiment analysis. For instance, by automating the process of analyzing customer feedback, businesses can gain valuable insights into their service quality and customer satisfaction levels efficiently.
